- name: Reducing bias in toxic comment classification
  descr: "Using a dataset of ~1.8m online comments, I have investigated how traditional ML models and NLP workflows can reinforce existing biases against minority groups. 
  In addition, I created a more sophisticated LSTM neural network model which achieves superior and less biased performance than the traditional ML models.
